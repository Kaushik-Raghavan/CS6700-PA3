# Programming Assignment 3

### Run
* It is recommended to use python version >= 3.5
* In the command line, after moving to the required directory where run.py file is present, type `python3 run.py`
* For each question, the learning methods are implemented in algorithms.py file which is imported in run.py file and used for demonstrations.

### Structure
* Code/Q1: Gridworld problem solved using SARSA, Q-learning
* Code/Q2: Cart-pole balancing using DQN (developed the code on template that was given)
* Question file Q1 contains the two files run.py and algorithms.py while Q2 contains only run.py file.
* run.py contains the code that performs the experiment
* algorithms.py contains the implementation of the algorithms (Q-learning and SARSA for Q1, Policy gradient method for Q2)
* log files are erased for memory purposes
